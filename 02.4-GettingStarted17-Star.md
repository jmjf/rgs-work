# React 17: Getting Started - Star Match Game
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started

## What is it
* Simple math skills game
* Two panes, stars on left, 1-9 on right
* Count stars and enter with buttons (either number or numbers that sum to number)
* Can't reuse numbers; game always draws playable number of stars
* Time limit on game

## Static markup
* He provides most of the base stuff that isn't React specific
   * JSX for the board
   * Colors
   * Math bits
* I'm going to watch a bit and figure out how I might change it.
* But first, let's set up a work directory `matching-game`
   * `npx create-react-app matching-game --template typescript`
   * Set up `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`
   * Ensure it starts

**COMMIT 2.4.1 - CHORE: set up development directory for matching game**
