# React 17: Getting Started - Star Match Game
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started

## What is it
* Simple math skills game
* Two panes, stars on left, 1-9 on right
* Count stars and enter with buttons (either number or numbers that sum to number)
* Can't reuse numbers; game always draws playable number of stars
* Time limit on game

## Static markup
* He provides most of the base stuff that isn't React specific
   * JSX for the board
   * Colors
   * Math bits
* I'm going to watch a bit and figure out how I might change it.
* But first, let's set up a work directory `matching-game`
   * `npx create-react-app matching-game --template typescript`
   * Set up `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`
   * Ensure it starts

**COMMIT 2.4.1 - CHORE: set up development directory for matching game**

* Get the base code into the directory; reorganized slightly
* Download a couple of icons to use in place of stars
* Get it to display the game board with stars
* Replace the stars with icon (Intertwined Fate)

* Replace hard-coded grid of icons with variable number
* Replace hard-coded number grid with similar
* `useState()` for icon count
   * Rule of thumb: Whenever a data element used in the UI will change values, make it a state element; optimize later if needed

**COMMIT 2.4.2 - FEAT: get basic game board working; replace stars with icon; replace static JSX elements with dynamic**

## Breaking down components
* What makes sense in terms of breaking down the components?
   * Many items that share similar data or behavior -> candidate for an item component (numbers)
   * Does it make the code more readable?
   * Be cautious with naming to ensure you don't override native JS stuff
* Build `NumberButton`
* Add `onClick` to log the number when it's clicked.

**COMMIT 2.4.3 - REFACTOR: extract components for icon panel and number button**

## Making the buttons work
* Need to do some math
* When the sum adds up, turn numbers "used"
* If the sum is wrong, turn numbers "oops"

* Behavior involves application logic to change state and UI logic to describe the state (what will change)
* Need lists of numbers that are available (used numbers = not in list), candidate numbers ()
   * Don't store in state what you can reasonably compute
* Starting with UI (because we can set up fake data and see the UI behave as expected)
* The number buttons don't care about all the numbers, only it's number
   * Philosophy: `GameBoard` shouldn't know the details of color choice
   * `NumberButton` shouldn't need to know how to decide its state
   * `props` should contain only the data needed, think about how to do it efficiently and effectively -- reduce re-rendering
* Can use `Array.includes()` to decide state -- order of conditions matter
* Also need to decide if a number is a candidate or wrong -- new method

* `NumberButton` needs conditional style for color -- use `style` and lookup color in color dictionary

None of this manages the application logic around which numbers should be available, if it's right, etc., just shows we can control the UI correctly.

* Now that we've proven we can manipulate the UI correctly, initialize the number arrays
   * available -> all 9
   * candidate -> none

Key concepts here
* Placing UI logic in appropriate components
* Using state with fixed values to get the UI using the state correctly
   * How to choose values; how to think about how UI works
   * Set values to correct baseline after you have the UI working
* Start with the UI, not the business logic
   * The business logic will just set state, so figure out the state first

**COMMIT 2.4.4 - FEAT: add UI logic to set button colors based on selected and used buttons**

## Add the game logic
* When a button is clicked
   * Skip used numbers
   * If the number isn't selected add it to selected
   * Otherwise remove it from selected (unselect)
   * If selected isn't the right total, update selected (state)
   * Otherwise
      * Remove selected from available -> temp value
      * Get new iconCount based on new available
      * Set available to temp value
      * Set selected to empty
      * Order matters - when I did new iconCount last, it didn't set last number clicked as used
* To redraw icons, use `GameMath.randomSumIn()` and pass it the temp value and a max (9)

Key concept: We drive game play by changing state and letting the UI logic deal with display
   * Don't get hung up on the game logic; logic varies by application
   * Learn how to think about UI behavior in terms of state and controlling the UI by changing state

**COMMIT 2.4.5 - FEAT: add game logic to play the game**

**So, a key point of the previous couple of sections has been, understand your application state (data) and drive your application's UI and behavior through state.**

## Add play again option
The game is playable, now we need to restart it.
* Need a restart button that resets the state (all numbers available, nothing selected, random iconCount)
* Need to control when the button appears
* I'm guessing this will be a separate component and will use some kind of conditional display based on state (no numbers available)
   * If the game is done -> Play Again button
   * Otherwise `IconPanel`

* Don't do computation in JSX templates. Do them in variables based on state (so will mutate with state).
* `isGameDone` if no numbers left (and in future if time reaches 0)
* Generally think of component flow as:
   * Initialize state
   * Hooks into side effects
   * Computation based on state
   * Component logic
   * UI template (JSX)

* Add computation for `isGameOver`
* Add conditional logic to template to display either `IconPanel` or `ResetButton`
* Create `ResetButton` component
   * Don't worry about logic or event handling. See if it displays when the game is over.
* Now that's working, so let's reset the state
   * I'm guessing the reset logic might stay on `GameBoard` and be handled in a function that gets passed as a prop

This works for now, but we'll have to deal with the timer (side effect), which will push us to a different approach.

**COMMIT: 2.4.6 - FEAT: add button and logic to restart game when it's over**

## The timer (and side effects)
Timer value needs to be in state so it can trigger a render when it changes.
   * I'm guessing we'll add a `setTimeout()` or similar that will decrement and set another timeout until it's 0.
   * Will also need logic in `isGameOver` to detect time = 0

We could use `setInterval()`. 
Or React will run `GameBoard()` every time state changes. So can use `setTimeout()` to change state.

### React side effects
* `useEffect()` hook runs a function every time owner component renders itself
* (`useState()` is also a hook)

So, `useEffect()` to set a timeout that will decrement time remaining (if > 0, otherwise we keep counting into negative numbers).

Possible issue: `useEffect()` runs every time state changes (because component renders), which can create problems because it's triggering the call every time creating another timeout. So, we need to "clean" it so it doesn't run again. (One solution I can think of is a variable that tells us if a timeout is already running, reset when `setTimeout()` function runs, set when `useEffect()` runs.)

If `useEffect()` returns a function, that function runs when the component is unmounting (about to rerender) vs code in the function passed that runs when the component finishes rendering.

```JavaScript
useEffect(() ={
   console.log('rendered, set side effect');
   return () => console.log('unmounting, clean side effect');
});
```

If we have a handle to the timer, we can `clearTimeout()` on the timer. But the way he does it, you can stop the timer by clicking on a UI component over and over (because it keeps resetting the timeout).

He isn't going to solve the problem in this version (refers to https://jscomplete.com/rgs-hooks). I'm going to use my solution for now.
* Ah, but that requires a useRef hook (VS Code warns me) because changing it in `useEffect()` will be lost. So leave with the cheat option for now.

Changing logic to detect won (available = none) vs. lost (time = 0) to display a conditional message (replace `isGameDone` with `gameStatus` which is win, lose, or playing).
   * Philosophy: avoid overlapping variables (like `isWon` and `isLost`) in favor of an explicit status -> clearer, less data to maintain
And pass `gameStatus` to the reset button so we can display different messages. Let's rename `ResetGame` to `ResetGamePanel`.

Resetting the timer on game reset it part of the next section. For now
* Stop the timer when the game isn't in `playing` status.
* Only accept button clicks in `playing` status.

**COMMIT: 2.4.7 - FEAT: make the timer work; display win/lose messages; don't accept UI actions for ended games**

Now, need to reset the timer on game reset. And to do that, we need to clean any side effects. Could reset in the reset function. Better to unmount the component, which will trigger clean side effects and reset the state when it's reloaded.

He's going to create a component to hold `GameBoard` so he can unmount it. I decided to change the icon for a better name. That required some styling changes.

He got an error on reset because he removed the reset function but didn't remove it. (TS would have complained.) So instead of resetting the game with the function, we want the wrapper (`CountThePaimons`) to unmount/remount the component.

If we assign the `<GameBoard />` a `key` and change the key value, it will unmount/remount.
* So, I added a state variable to `CountThePaimons` initialized to 1.
* Passed to the `GameBoard` with an arrow function that sets state to current value + 1
* Called that function to reset the game.

Now let's see if he does something different. (He didn't.)

**COMMIT: 2.4.8 - REFACTOR: reset game by unmount/remount the component so it also resets the timer**

## Game component improvements (custom hooks)
The `GameBoard` is huge because it's the only manager of the game's state. It has responsibilities for both managing the whole game and rendering it.
