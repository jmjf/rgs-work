# React 17: Getting Started - Star Match Game
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started

## What is it
* Simple math skills game
* Two panes, stars on left, 1-9 on right
* Count stars and enter with buttons (either number or numbers that sum to number)
* Can't reuse numbers; game always draws playable number of stars
* Time limit on game

## Static markup
* He provides most of the base stuff that isn't React specific
   * JSX for the board
   * Colors
   * Math bits
* I'm going to watch a bit and figure out how I might change it.
* But first, let's set up a work directory `matching-game`
   * `npx create-react-app matching-game --template typescript`
   * Set up `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`
   * Ensure it starts

**COMMIT 2.4.1 - CHORE: set up development directory for matching game**

* Get the base code into the directory; reorganized slightly
* Download a couple of icons to use in place of stars
* Get it to display the game board with stars
* Replace the stars with icon (Intertwined Fate)

* Replace hard-coded grid of icons with variable number
* Replace hard-coded number grid with similar
* `useState()` for icon count
   * Rule of thumb: Whenever a data element used in the UI will change values, make it a state element; optimize later if needed

**COMMIT 2.4.2 - FEAT: get basic game board working; replace stars with icon; replace static JSX elements with dynamic**

## Breaking down components
* What makes sense in terms of breaking down the components?
   * Many items that share similar data or behavior -> candidate for an item component (numbers)
   * Does it make the code more readable?
   * Be cautious with naming to ensure you don't override native JS stuff
* Build `NumberButton`
* Add `onClick` to log the number when it's clicked.

**COMMIT 2.4.3 - REFACTOR: extract components for icon panel and number button**
