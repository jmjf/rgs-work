# React 17: Getting Started - Star Match Game
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started

## What is it
* Simple math skills game
* Two panes, stars on left, 1-9 on right
* Count stars and enter with buttons (either number or numbers that sum to number)
* Can't reuse numbers; game always draws playable number of stars
* Time limit on game

## Static markup
* He provides most of the base stuff that isn't React specific
   * JSX for the board
   * Colors
   * Math bits
* I'm going to watch a bit and figure out how I might change it.
* But first, let's set up a work directory `matching-game`
   * `npx create-react-app matching-game --template typescript`
   * Set up `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`
   * Ensure it starts

**COMMIT 2.4.1 - CHORE: set up development directory for matching game**

* Get the base code into the directory; reorganized slightly
* Download a couple of icons to use in place of stars
* Get it to display the game board with stars
* Replace the stars with icon (Intertwined Fate)

* Replace hard-coded grid of icons with variable number
* Replace hard-coded number grid with similar
* `useState()` for icon count
   * Rule of thumb: Whenever a data element used in the UI will change values, make it a state element; optimize later if needed

**COMMIT 2.4.2 - FEAT: get basic game board working; replace stars with icon; replace static JSX elements with dynamic**

## Breaking down components
* What makes sense in terms of breaking down the components?
   * Many items that share similar data or behavior -> candidate for an item component (numbers)
   * Does it make the code more readable?
   * Be cautious with naming to ensure you don't override native JS stuff
* Build `NumberButton`
* Add `onClick` to log the number when it's clicked.

**COMMIT 2.4.3 - REFACTOR: extract components for icon panel and number button**

## Making the buttons work
* Need to do some math
* When the sum adds up, turn numbers "used"
* If the sum is wrong, turn numbers "oops"

* Behavior involves application logic to change state and UI logic to describe the state (what will change)
* Need lists of numbers that are available (used numbers = not in list), candidate numbers ()
   * Don't store in state what you can reasonably compute
* Starting with UI (because we can set up fake data and see the UI behave as expected)
* The number buttons don't care about all the numbers, only it's number
   * Philosophy: `GameBoard` shouldn't know the details of color choice
   * `NumberButton` shouldn't need to know how to decide its state
   * `props` should contain only the data needed, think about how to do it efficiently and effectively -- reduce re-rendering
* Can use `Array.includes()` to decide state -- order of conditions matter
* Also need to decide if a number is a candidate or wrong -- new method

* `NumberButton` needs conditional style for color -- use `style` and lookup color in color dictionary

None of this manages the application logic around which numbers should be available, if it's right, etc., just shows we can control the UI correctly.

* Now that we've proven we can manipulate the UI correctly, initialize the number arrays
   * available -> all 9
   * candidate -> none

Key concepts here
* Placing UI logic in appropriate components
* Using state with fixed values to get the UI using the state correctly
   * How to choose values; how to think about how UI works
   * Set values to correct baseline after you have the UI working
* Start with the UI, not the business logic
   * The business logic will just set state, so figure out the state first

**COMMIT 2.4.4 - FEAT: add UI logic to set button colors based on selected and used buttons**
