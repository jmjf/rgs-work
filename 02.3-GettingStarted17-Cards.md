# React 17: Getting Started - GitHub Cards
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started

## What it does
* Enter a GitHub user name
* Click a button
* Add a card for the GH user to a list of cards
* Work with data input, API calls, reusable components, etc.

## Diversion
* I know he's going to set up a dev environment at the end of the course, but I want it now.
* I'll use a Genshin Impact API to show character info
   * https://genshin-app-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters/info/[charname]?infoDataSize=minimal
   * res.error (false)
   * res.payload.character.name, title, element, weapon, nation, iconURL (has the image)
* I want TypeScript, so let's try `npx create-react-app genshin-cards --template typescript`
   * Updated `README.md`
   * Added `LICENSE.md` (MIT)
* Seems to have worked -- default application comes up. Let's get the application title showing on the page.
* Latest React 18, seems to be a bit different than React 17.
   * Default structure has `index.tsx` which wants `app.tsx` to give it an `App` to build.
   * If `App` is a function, it must return something. If a class, it needs a `render` function.
   * Need to declare an `interface` for `props` (I'm guessing that's strict TS).
   * If destructuring to get only `title` from `props`, need `({title}: AppProps)` so it knows `title` is a string (more TS).
   * And need to pass `title` attribute from `index.tsx`, of course.
   * Remove code from the default test or it will complain.
* But, I now have it working as both a function and a class.

**COMMIT: 2.3.1 - CHORE: get application working in local dev environment**

## Back to the course
* Have a basic idea of the component structure
* Work based on what you know
* Refactor, rename, improve as you go
* The blank page is your biggest enemy

## Thinking about structure
* Based on the description, what components do we have?
   * card, card list, input + button

## Class components
* `extends React.Component`
* Must have a `render()` function, which must return the virtual DOM description
* With class components, `props` are on `this` (`this.props.title` for example)

Build the `CharacterCard` component with a place holder `<div>` and text. Add it to the App.
Move the component CSS into the component CSS files.
Import those files into the components so they're used.
Confirm it's all rendering sanely.

**COMMIT 2.3.2 - FEAT: add character card component, basic structure**

## Styling alternative
* Replace `className` with `style={{<style info>}}`
   * This is not handlebars or a special notation, it's a standard React `{}` JS inject with a JS object inside it
* `<style info>` is an object notation style sheet of sorts 
   * `{{ display: 'inline-block', marginLeft: 10 }}` 10px assumed, could use `1rem` or similar
* This styling approach is subject to debate. If changing styles on the fly or conditional styles, it can be useful.
   * Conditional style: `style={{ color: Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'green' : 'blue'}}`
* Also be aware of libraries that offer stronger CSS in JS support

## Data
* Set up an array with some data samples so we can build stuff. We'll call the API later. Can have just the parts we care about.

```typescript
const testData = [
   {
      error: false,
      payload: {
         character: {
         name: 'Amber',
			description: `Always energetic and full of life, Amber's the best - albeit only - Outrider of the Knights of Favonius.`,
			element: 'Pyro',
			weaponType: 'Bow',
         iconURL: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dnoibyqq2/image/upload/v1622044760/genshin-app/characters/amber/icon.png'
         }
      }
   },
   {
      error: false,
      payload: {
         character: {
         name: 'Bennett',
			description: `A righteous and good-natured adventurer from Mondstadt who's unfortunately extremely unlucky.`
			element: 'Pyro',
			weaponType: 'Sword',
         iconURL: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dnoibyqq2/image/upload/v1622044760/genshin-app/characters/bennett/icon.png'
         }
      }
   },
   {
      error: false,
      payload: {
         character: {
         name: 'Chongyun',
			description: `A young exortcist from a family of exorcists. He does everything he can to suppress his pure positive energy.`
			element: 'Cryo',
			weaponType: 'Claymore',
         iconURL: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dnoibyqq2/image/upload/v1622044760/genshin-app/characters/chongyun/icon.png'
         }
      }
   },
   {
      error: false,
      payload: {
         character: {
         name: 'Kazuha',
			description: `A wandering samurai from Inazuma who is currently with Liyue's Crux Fleet. A gentle and carefree soul whose heart hides a great many burdens from the past. It's hard to say if weathering life's storms has eroded any sharp edges he once had or his reserved nature keeps them hidden from view. The first time most people meet Kaedehara Kazuha, they presume he is just another trainee crew member aboard The Crux.`
			element: 'Anemo',
			weaponType: 'Sword',
         iconURL: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dnoibyqq2/image/upload/v1625656971/genshin-app/characters/kazuha/icon.png'
         }
      }
   }, 
];
```

## Building the list component
* `class CardList extends React.Component {}`
* He uses a function component because he wants to make the point that you may mix types in a single application.
   * No real discussion of why you might choose one over the other.
   * I'll switch to a function component, just to humor him for now.
* Define the test data array in `App`.
* Pass it to `CardList` in `props`.
* `CardList` renders a couple of `CharacterCard`s with data from `props.data[0]` and `props.data[1]` to test
   * Uses `<CharacterCard {...props.data[0].payload.character} />` to pass all as individual entries in `props`
* `CharacterCard`
   * `charInfo = this.props as CharacterCardProps` to give it a more descriptive name
   * Then use `{}` to use values from `charInfo` to replace hard coded placeholder text

This is working. Now to get it to use whatever is in the data array.
* `{}` lets you write JS/TS inside JSX HTML-ish.
* Use `Array.map()` to render cards. `forEach()` does not work because React wants an array.
* Adjusted `CharacterCard` styles because long descriptions where breaking the wrapping; `max-width: 45%` for sanity

**COMMIT: 2.3.3 - FEAT: add a CardList and use data (props) to render cards**
