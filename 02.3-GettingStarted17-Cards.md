# React 17: Getting Started - GitHub Cards
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started

## What it does
* Enter a GitHub user name
* Click a button
* Add a card for the GH user to a list of cards
* Work with data input, API calls, reusable components, etc.

## Diversion
* I know he's going to set up a dev environment at the end of the course, but I want it now.
* I'll use a Genshin Impact API to show character info
   * https://genshin-app-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters/info/[charname]?infoDataSize=minimal
   * res.error (false)
   * res.payload.character.name, title, element, weapon, nation, iconURL (has the image)
* I want TypeScript, so let's try `npx create-react-app genshin-cards --template typescript`
   * Updated `README.md`
   * Added `LICENSE.md` (MIT)
* Seems to have worked -- default application comes up. Let's get the application title showing on the page.
* Latest React 18, seems to be a bit different than React 17.
   * Default structure has `index.tsx` which wants `app.tsx` to give it an `App` to build.
   * If `App` is a function, it must return something. If a class, it needs a `render` function.
   * Need to declare an `interface` for `props` (I'm guessing that's strict TS).
   * If destructuring to get only `title` from `props`, need `({title}: AppProps)` so it knows `title` is a string (more TS).
   * And need to pass `title` attribute from `index.tsx`, of course.
   * Remove code from the default test or it will complain.
* But, I now have it working as both a function and a class.

**COMMIT: 2.3.1 - CHORE: get application working in local dev environment**

## Back to the course
* Have a basic idea of the component structure
* Work based on what you know
* Refactor, rename, improve as you go
* The blank page is your biggest enemy

## Thinking about structure
* Based on the description, what components do we have?
   * card, card list, input + button

## Class components
* `extends React.Component`
* Must have a `render()` function, which must return the virtual DOM description
* With class components, `props` are on `this` (`this.props.title` for example)

Build the `CharacterCard` component with a place holder `<div>` and text. Add it to the App.
Move the component CSS into the component CSS files.
Import those files into the components so they're used.
Confirm it's all rendering sanely.

**COMMIT 2.3.2 - FEAT: add character card component, basic structure**

## Styling alternative
* Replace `className` with `style={{<style info>}}`
   * This is not handlebars or a special notation, it's a standard React `{}` JS inject with a JS object inside it
* `<style info>` is an object notation style sheet of sorts 
   * `{{ display: 'inline-block', marginLeft: 10 }}` 10px assumed, could use `1rem` or similar
* This styling approach is subject to debate. If changing styles on the fly or conditional styles, it can be useful.
   * Conditional style: `style={{ color: Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'green' : 'blue'}}`
* Also be aware of libraries that offer stronger CSS in JS support

## Data
* Set up an array with some data samples so we can build stuff. We'll call the API later. Can have just the parts we care about.

```typescript
const testData = [
   {
      error: false,
      payload: {
         character: {
         name: 'Amber',
			description: `Always energetic and full of life, Amber's the best - albeit only - Outrider of the Knights of Favonius.`,
			element: 'Pyro',
			weaponType: 'Bow',
         iconURL: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dnoibyqq2/image/upload/v1622044760/genshin-app/characters/amber/icon.png'
         }
      }
   },
   {
      error: false,
      payload: {
         character: {
         name: 'Bennett',
			description: `A righteous and good-natured adventurer from Mondstadt who's unfortunately extremely unlucky.`
			element: 'Pyro',
			weaponType: 'Sword',
         iconURL: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dnoibyqq2/image/upload/v1622044760/genshin-app/characters/bennett/icon.png'
         }
      }
   },
   {
      error: false,
      payload: {
         character: {
         name: 'Chongyun',
			description: `A young exortcist from a family of exorcists. He does everything he can to suppress his pure positive energy.`
			element: 'Cryo',
			weaponType: 'Claymore',
         iconURL: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dnoibyqq2/image/upload/v1622044760/genshin-app/characters/chongyun/icon.png'
         }
      }
   },
   {
      error: false,
      payload: {
         character: {
         name: 'Kazuha',
			description: `A wandering samurai from Inazuma who is currently with Liyue's Crux Fleet. A gentle and carefree soul whose heart hides a great many burdens from the past. It's hard to say if weathering life's storms has eroded any sharp edges he once had or his reserved nature keeps them hidden from view. The first time most people meet Kaedehara Kazuha, they presume he is just another trainee crew member aboard The Crux.`
			element: 'Anemo',
			weaponType: 'Sword',
         iconURL: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dnoibyqq2/image/upload/v1625656971/genshin-app/characters/kazuha/icon.png'
         }
      }
   }, 
];
```

## Building the list component
* `class CardList extends React.Component {}`
* He uses a function component because he wants to make the point that you may mix types in a single application.
   * No real discussion of why you might choose one over the other.
   * I'll switch to a function component, just to humor him for now.
* Define the test data array in `App`.
* Pass it to `CardList` in `props`.
* `CardList` renders a couple of `CharacterCard`s with data from `props.data[0]` and `props.data[1]` to test
   * Uses `<CharacterCard {...props.data[0].payload.character} />` to pass all as individual entries in `props`
* `CharacterCard`
   * `charInfo = this.props as CharacterCardProps` to give it a more descriptive name
   * Then use `{}` to use values from `charInfo` to replace hard coded placeholder text

This is working. Now to get it to use whatever is in the data array.
* `{}` lets you write JS/TS inside JSX HTML-ish.
* Use `Array.map()` to render cards. `forEach()` does not work because React wants an array.
* Adjusted `CharacterCard` styles because long descriptions where breaking the wrapping; `max-width: 45%` for sanity

**COMMIT: 2.3.3 - FEAT: add a CardList and use data (props) to render cards**

## User input and state
* Create an input form component that renders a <form> with an input and a button.
* Render the form in `App`.
* Added styles to make it look decent
* It makes sense to keep the list of characters on the `App` and pass the data to the components that need it as `props`
* Want to use state to store the data.
   * Option 1: Use a constructor on `App` and set `this.state = { data: testData }`
   * Option 2: Define `state` attribute of `App`
   * Need to declare an interface for state and `extends React.Component<IAppProps, IAppState>`

* Now we need to get input when the Add button is clicked (`UserInputForm`)
   * Use `onSubmit` on form.
   * Define `handleSubmit()` and bind it to `onSubmit`
   * `ev.preventDefault()` in the handler -- you almost always want to do this to avoid a full page rebuild
   * Get input value option 1 -  use a reference
      * Define a reference (`React.createRef()`) on the class
      * Bind it to the input (`ref={this.nameInput}`)
      * In the handler `this.nameInput.current?.value` gets the input value
**COMMIT 2.3.4 - FEAT: get input using a reference (console.log() value)**

   * Get input value option 2 - controlled components
      * Add `state = {}` to the class.
      * Add an attribute to `state` to hold the input value
      * Bind the element to the input with the `value` attribute
      * Add an `onChange` handler -- `onChange={event => this.setState({ name: event.target.value })}`
      * Benefit over reference: React is aware of changes as they happen so can act based on changes
         * But if you don't need that, references can work too
**COMMIT: 2.3.5 - REFACTOR: replace reference with controlled component**

## Make the API call
* Let's use `axios` (`npm install axios`)
* `axios.get()` the URL (template string to inject name)
* Remember to `async/await`
* The response `data` attribute has the data we want to add
* BUT, the form can't update `App`'s state
* So add an `addData()` function on `App` and pass it to the form in `props`
   * It fails if `addData()` isn't written as an arrow function, I'm guessing because of differences in how `this` is handled.
* Updating state in `App.addData()`
   * `this.setState(prevState => { data: [...prevState.data, newData ]} )`
* When rendering dynamic children in a list, include a `key` prop that is unique
* Added error handling and message, checking for duplicates, etc.

**COMMIT 2.3.6 - FEAT: get data from the API and display it**

## Better error handling
* Need different messages for 404 vs. other errors
* Problem: The API seem to return only 404, even if I use an invalid route
* Code is written and should work, but can't test

* Put components in `src/components` -- cleaner

**COMMIT: 2.3.7 - FEAT: better error handling; CHORE: organize components better**

## Move API call to an adapter
* Create a module that has an API adapter with a method to get the data
* Use the adapter instead of a direct call in the handler
* Return a `Result`

* Found an API I like better: https://github.com/impact-moe/impact-api/wiki
   * Returns 204 if character doesn't exist
   * Returns 404 if invalid route

### Plan
* Start `GenshinDataAdapter` -- define interface
* Define `ICharacterProps` that includes only data I want
* `getCharacter(id: string): Result<ICharacterProps, Error>`
   * Refer to code currently in the handler
   * Use current API for now
   * Data: id, name, weapon, element, region, faction, imageUrl
   * For current API, name and id are same, return field name if the value is undefined
* Change handler to use adapter
* Ensure everything still works

* Replace API calls with new API
* Ensure everything still works

* Define `ICharacterListProps` with character name and id
* `getCharacterList(): Result<ICharacterListProps, Error>`
   * Use to build a select of characters to replace the input
   * Data: id, name (select displays name, use id to get data)

* Could add methods for other data types (weapons, etc.) later

### GenshinApiAdapter
* `src/adapters/GenshinApiAdapter`
* Define interface `IGenshinApiAdapter`
* `src/adapters/impl/GenshinApiAdapter-GenshinAppApi`
* Write impl based on existing code
* Use in `UserInputForm`

* Changes to `CharacterCard` because interface and attributes changed.
* Changes to `CardList` because simplified data coming back
* Changes to `App` because
   * `addData` -> simplified data structure
   * `render` -> need to pass the adapter

**COMMIT 2.3.8 - REFACTOR: replace embedded API call with an adapter**

### Switch to impact.moe API
* Write a new impl for the new API, can probably copy much of existing impl
* CORS!!!! Sometimes I hate CORS. I'm getting a browser error because the API isn't setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.
   * Using `proxy` in `package.json` isn't working.
   * Let's try proxying manually based on https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/#configuring-the-proxy-manually
   * That isn't working either. Nor are several other things I've tried. ARGH!
   * And firefox is showing the call to impact.moe in the Network tab in DevTools. And I don't see it logged in the dev server log. Something here is not behaving as it should.

This is very frustrating. I'm finding example after example that says:
* Use `"proxy"` in `package.json`, and I see it redirecting, but it doesn't add a CORS header to the response.
* LogRocket has a post that talks about using an object for `"proxy"` which is failing because proxy must be a string.
* The official CRA docs example for using `http-proxy-middleware` don't work.

In the browser Network tab, I see a 301 and the browser seems to know that it's actually calling impact.moe. I've tried using `onProxyRes` in `http-proxy-middleware` to inject the header, but it doesn't seem to work.

Tried `fetch` instead of `axios` but still not working.

Maybe I could set up an express server to act as proxy, but not worth the effort. Switch back to the other adapter.

Renamed `setupProxy.js` to `.jsz` so it's there for reference but not actually loaded.

**COMMIT: 2.3.9 - FEAT: add adapter for a different api; but not working because CORS and proxy isn't solving it**
