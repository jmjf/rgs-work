# React 17: Getting Started - GitHub Cards
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started

## What it does
* Enter a GitHub user name
* Click a button
* Add a card for the GH user to a list of cards
* Work with data input, API calls, reusable components, etc.

## Diversion
* I know he's going to set up a dev environment at the end of the course, but I want it now.
* I'll use a Genshin Impact API to show character info
   * https://genshin-app-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters/info/[charname]?infoDataSize=minimal
   * res.error (false)
   * res.payload.character.name, title, element, weapon, nation, iconURL (has the image)
* I want TypeScript, so let's try `npx create-react-app genshin-cards --template typescript`
   * Updated `README.md`
   * Added `LICENSE.md` (MIT)
* Seems to have worked -- default application comes up. Let's get the application title showing on the page.
* Latest React 18, seems to be a bit different than React 17.
   * Default structure has `index.tsx` which wants `app.tsx` to give it an `App` to build.
   * If `App` is a function, it must return something. If a class, it needs a `render` function.
   * Need to declare an `interface` for `props` (I'm guessing that's strict TS).
   * If destructuring to get only `title` from `props`, need `({title}: AppProps)` so it knows `title` is a string (more TS).
   * And need to pass `title` attribute from `index.tsx`, of course.
   * Remove code from the default test or it will complain.
* But, I now have it working as both a function and a class.

**COMMIT: 2.3.1 - CHORE: get application working in local dev environment**
