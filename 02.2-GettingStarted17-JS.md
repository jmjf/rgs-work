# React 17: Getting Started - Modern JS
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started

## List of modern JS features covered
* Block scopes leak `var` variables; use `let` to avoid leaks
   * `let v = 100;` can be reassigned (`v = 200;` is okay)
   * `const` is a reference assigned to a variable; cannot be changed
   * `const v = 100;` can't assign a new value to v
   * `const o = { a: 'Hello', b: 'world' };` can't reassign `o`, but `o.a = 'Goodbye'` is allowed

* Arrow functions
   * `const f1 = function () {};` binds `this` depending on how it is called (based on caller or environment)
   * `const f2 = () => {};` binds `this` depending on where it is defined
   * shortcut to avoid `{}` in arrow functions if it is a single expression

* Object literal syntax
   * Can define attributes as `a1: 'Hello'`
   * Can define functions as `f1() {}` or `f2: () => {}` style
   * Can define attributes based on a dynamic value as `[dynamic]: 30` (member name depends on the value of a variable named `dynamic`)
   * Shortcut for variable-based properties with same name `v2` with no `: v2` after

* Destructuring and Rest/Spread
   * `const {a, b, c} = obj` where `obj` has attributes named `a`, `b`, and `c` gives three variables with same name
   * Can use destructuring in function parameters to extract individual parameters from a passed object
      * Common to destructure `props` in React function components
      * `opts` as another use case for destructuring
      * Can use default values with destructuring `({a = 2})` gets value of `a` if passed object has an attribute `a` or `2` if not
   * `const [a, b, , d] = [1, 2, 3, 4]` sets `a`, `b`, and `d` (1, 2, 4)
      * Common to destructure result of `useState()`
   * Rest/Spread
      * `const [a, ...others] = [1, 2, 3, 4]` sets `a` to the first array member and `others` to an array of remaining members
      * `const { a, b, ...others } = stuff` sets `a` and `b` based on same-named members of `stuff`, `others` is an object of the remaining attributes
      * `const a = [...others]` or `const a = {...others}` creates new array/object (`a`) with members/attributes from `others` -- shallow copy

* Template strings
   * String literals are `'string'` or `"string"`
   * Template strings are surrounded by backticks and offer value interpolation with `${value}` syntax

* Classes
```JavaScript
class Animal { 
   attr = 123;
   constructor(name) {
      this.name = name
   };
   makeSound() {
      console.log('Huh?');
   };
}

class Dog extends Animal {
   constructor(name, breed) {
      super(name);
      this.breed = breed;
   }
   makeSound() {
      console.log('Woof!');
   }
}

const new
```
   * `super()`
   * Can override methods on descendants or by replacing after creating the object (`o.makeSound = () => {}`)

* Promises and `async/await`
   * Overview of promises and promise based chaining (`.then()`)
   * `async/await` is preferred (simpler to read) -- note `async` functions return a Promise
```JavaScript
// async function f() {}
const f = async () => {
   const a = await f2();
   const b = await a.f3();
   console.log(b);
}
```
