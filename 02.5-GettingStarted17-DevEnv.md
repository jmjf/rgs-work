# Setting up a development environment
I've already done this, but let's see what he covers that I haven't done yet.

## Create React App
* Sets up a basic environment, but concealing the details conceals some of the knowledge.
* Need `node.js` first.
* Options:
   * `npm i -g create-react-app && create-react-app <new app>`
   * `npx create-react-app <new app>` <- preferred, pulls latest release
   * ALT: `npx create-react-app --template typescript <new app>` <- more preferred by me
* Understand the basic directory structure
   * `src` -> application source
   * `src/index.js` -> renders the application
   * `src/App.js` -> base application
* CRA sets up the build chain so you don't need to
   * `npm run eject` will export all the configuration into directories (`config` and `scripts`) if you want to dig into it and see how much work it is
   * BUT, eject is permanent, so choose carefully
