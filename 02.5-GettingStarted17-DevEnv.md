# Setting up a development environment
I've already done this, but let's see what he covers that I haven't done yet.

## Create React App
* Sets up a basic environment, but concealing the details conceals some of the knowledge.
* Need `node.js` first.
* Options:
   * `npm i -g create-react-app && create-react-app <new app>`
   * `npx create-react-app <new app>` <- preferred, pulls latest release
   * ALT: `npx create-react-app --template typescript <new app>` <- more preferred by me
* Understand the basic directory structure
   * `src` -> application source
   * `src/index.js` -> renders the application
   * `src/App.js` -> base application
* CRA sets up the build chain so you don't need to
   * `npm run eject` will export all the configuration into directories (`config` and `scripts`) if you want to dig into it and see how much work it is
   * BUT, eject is permanent, so choose carefully

**COMMIT 2.5.1 - DOCS: overview of create-react-app**

## Manual dev setup
* Tools change frequently. See https://jscomplete.com/reactful for an updated doc (using Babel and Webpack)
* Make a working directory and change to it. `npm init` it.
* If you need backend, install your backend framework (express, hapi, whatever)
* Dependencies
   * Install React components `react react-dom`
   * Install Webpack `webpack webpack-cli`
   * Install for Babel `babel-loader @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react` (you may need more)
      * preset-env may be less important if you aren't targeting old browsers
   * NOTE: If you're building a bundle and deploying the bundle to the server, React, Webpack, and Bable are dev dependencies
* Dev dependencies
   * `nodemon` watcher to restart node when changes saved
   * `eslint babel-eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks` because you want a linter
      * configure `.eslintrc.js` -- see link above for starter
   * Consider `prettier` to keep your code consistently formatted
   * `jest babel-jest react-test-renderer` to test
* Directory structure (Webpack default preferences)
```
project/
   dist/          (Compiled/bundled files)
      *.js
   src/           (React application)
      index.js
      components/ (May want subdirectories for larger groups of related components)
         app.js
         ...
      server/     (Backend)
         server.js
```
* Configure Webpack and Babel -- see link above for starter
* Add npm scripts -- see link
   * test (run tests)
   * dev:server (run backend)
   * dev:bundler (build dev version)
   * prod:bundler (build production version)
* Build a simple app to test it
   * Example at link assumes server side rendering - uses `hydrate` and express server
   * Good starting point for learning if you want to do SSR
