# Setting up a development environment

I've already done this, but let's see what he covers that I haven't done yet.

## Create React App

-   Sets up a basic environment, but concealing the details conceals some of the knowledge.
-   Need `node.js` first.
-   Options:
    -   `npm i -g create-react-app && create-react-app <new app>`
    -   `npx create-react-app <new app>` <- preferred, pulls latest release
    -   ALT: `npx create-react-app --template typescript <new app>` <- more preferred by me
-   Understand the basic directory structure
    -   `src` -> application source
    -   `src/index.js` -> renders the application
    -   `src/App.js` -> base application
-   CRA sets up the build chain so you don't need to
    -   `npm run eject` will export all the configuration into directories (`config` and `scripts`) if you want to dig into it and see how much work it is
    -   BUT, eject is permanent, so choose carefully

## Manual dev setup

-   Tools change frequently. See https://jscomplete.com/reactful for an updated doc (using Babel and Webpack)
-   Make a working directory and change to it. `npm init` it.
-   If you need backend, install your backend framework (express, hapi, whatever)
-   Dependencies
    -   Install React components `react react-dom`
    -   Install Webpack `webpack webpack-cli`
    -   Install for Babel `babel-loader @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react` (you may need more)
        -   preset-env may be less important if you aren't targeting old browsers
    -   NOTE: If you're building a bundle and deploying the bundle to the server, React, Webpack, and Bable are dev dependencies
-   Dev dependencies
    -   `nodemon` watcher to restart node when changes saved
    -   `eslint babel-eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks` because you want a linter
        -   configure `.eslintrc.js` -- see link above for starter
    -   Consider `prettier` to keep your code consistently formatted
    -   `jest babel-jest react-test-renderer` to test
-   Directory structure (Webpack default preferences)

```
project/
   dist/          (Compiled/bundled files)
      *.js
   src/           (React application)
      index.js
      components/ (May want subdirectories for larger groups of related components)
         app.js
         ...
      server/     (Backend)
         server.js
```

-   Configure Webpack and Babel -- see link above for starter
-   Add npm scripts -- see link
    -   test (run tests)
    -   dev:server (run backend)
    -   dev:bundler (build dev version)
    -   prod:bundler (build production version)
-   Build a simple app to test it
    -   Example at link assumes server side rendering - uses `hydrate` and express server
    -   Good starting point for learning if you want to do SSR

**COMMIT: 2.5.2 - DOCS: manual dev environment setup**

## Reactful

-   Instructor has an application that builds a dev environment based on https://jscomplete.com/reactful
    -   `npx reactful <app-name>`
-   Conceptually similar to CRA, but more barebones, ejected, and setup for SSR
-   Adds different npm scripts to make build, dev, etc., smoother
-   Slightly more sophisticated configuration for tools
-   Directory structure adds `views`, `src/renderers`, `src/styles`

-   Sets up matching game in a Reactful dev space as a starting point
    -   Have `App` return the main component (like my version does because I was using a CRA environment)
    -   Import any missing imports. Resolve other linter, formatting, etc., errors.

**COMMIT: 2.5.3 - DOCS: overview of Reactful and moving an application into the structure it builds**

## Breaking down into components

-   Instructor is using his game from the playground, which has everything in one file.
-   One component per file
    -   Most components go in the `src/components` directory, but he puts game utilities in `src` (i created a separate `src/utils` in case I had other utility type parts)
    -   `Game` and `useGameState` make sense to keep together (probably)
-   See also GitHub `jscomplete/rgs‑star‑match`
