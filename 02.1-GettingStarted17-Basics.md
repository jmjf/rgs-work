# React 17: Getting Started - Basics
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started

## Basic concepts
* Components - receive inputs, output a UI
   * Function components are defined as a function (preferred)
   * Class components are defined as a class
   * All components have `props` (immutable, parameter) and `state` (mutable, defined in component) inputs
* Reactive updates - browser output changes in response to component state
* Virtual views in memory - HTML generated from JS rather than enhancing HTML (template language)
   * Write something like HTML in JS (JSX) which compiles to JS that creates the DOM

## First component
* Button with a number; clicking button counts clicks
* But first
   * https://jscomplete.com/playground - useful for early exploration
   * Hello React component and render
   * Demonstrates how JSX converted to JS (`createElement()`) in Babel REPL
* Create a button element
   * `useState()` hook enables state for a component; returns an array with the getter and a setter; use [] destructuring to get them
   * `useState(initialValue)` - `<button onClick={() => setter(v)}>{v}</button>`
* Now start with 5, double value each click

## One way data flow
* Basic reformatting of the JSX to be prettier
* Extract click handler from inline function to `const handleClick = () => ...`
* Add a new component to display the value of the counter
* Can render multiple elements by:
   * Passing an array of elements to `ReactDOM.render()`
   * Render the elements inside a container (`div`) or `React.Fragment`
   * Make a component of components and only `render()` the wrapper component (often `App`)
* Challenge, display component needs the state that's currently in the button component
   * Put it in the parent component
   * Pass counter to the display component (`props` in child)
   * Pass function to increment counter to button component (in `props`)
* When building components, think about which component is reasonably responsible for state and related business logic
   * Usually as close to children as possible, but maybe not directly on children
   * In this example, `App` owns the state and logic because the other components are low level. But if `App` were `ButtonWithCounter` and was used in another component, state for the counter would stay with `ButtonWithCounter` unless it needed state from its parent. This approach makes components more reusable.

## Reusable components
* Pass an increment value to the button to make a +n button
* Change the increment function to increment by different values based on button
   * Need to make button's `handleClick()` do the increment because `onClick` requires a **function reference**

## Tree reconcilliation
* Example: A div with an input and current time in HTML and React; `setInterval` to render ever second to increment the time
* Demonstrates that HTML renders everything every time while React only renders the time
* With HTML, input will be lost every render cycle, but not in React because the input isn't rendered
* Main advantage: Makes writing UIs that need to change easier

## My code
```JavaScript
function CountButton(props) {
  const clickHandler = () => props.onClickFunction(props.incValue);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={clickHandler}>
      +{props.incValue}
    </button>
  );
}

function DisplayCounter(props) {
  return <div>{props.message}</div>;
}

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const incrementCount = (inc) => setCount(count + inc);
  
  return (
  <React.Fragment>
    <CountButton onClickFunction={incrementCount} incValue={1}/>
    <CountButton onClickFunction={incrementCount} incValue={10}/>
    <CountButton onClickFunction={incrementCount} incValue={100}/>
    <DisplayCounter message={count}/>
  </React.Fragment>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('mountNode')
);
```
